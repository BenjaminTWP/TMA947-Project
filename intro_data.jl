# Small data file to show how one can import julia files into other julia files.
# It, e.g., gives a convenient way to create files containing all the data for a problem.

n_vars = 2 # Number of variables
lb = [-1, -4] # Lower bounds for the varaibles
ub = [3, 0] # Upper bounds for the variable
sum_bound = 0.49 # Constraint on sum of variables
